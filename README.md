# Swarm-Drone

This project is my final year project on basic simulation of swarm drones.As a student with less mathematical background and resources I have used combination of A* and Genetic Algorithm that have made this project come to life. However this project lacks much more as it is only a foundation for the swarm. In future ,I plan on first using advanced path searching algorithms and other features before implementing in hardware. If you have any ideas feel free to contact me so that we can colloborate and work together on this project. I will further update on any improvements in this project
